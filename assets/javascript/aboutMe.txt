My name is Peter i am living the last 9 years in Melbourne. In September of 2011 
                    i finished from the Greek army.  After i started to look for job but it was 
                    challenging because the European economy effect most Greece at this time. My 
                    decision it was to come to Melbourne for two reasons first to see the city i 
                    was born and second better opportunity for me. The begin i was disappointed for 
                    me but after 9 years here i love Melbourne. The only first two months i was 
                    unemployment. My first job is in the same factory I am at this time. I started 
                    in the production of mattresses . One year later I moved in better position at 
                    receiving department with more responsibilities. And now I am enrol in the boot 
                    camp in Monash, to extend my skills and to become web developer. My goals from 
                    this course is first to graduate from the boot camp and to make my wife proud 
                    for me. Second to be a web developer and third to find job as web developer.
