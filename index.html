              Hi, I am Peter. I am currently studying Front -End Web Developer.
              </p>
              <p> the past, I worked as a Technology Assistant in a lab. I was required to install, 
              diagnose, repair and replace hardware and software, and communicated the problems with 
              my customers in a simple way they would understand.  Since then I found my passion with 
              computing and software and I always have a life long passion for learning.  I always 
              strive to achieve individually in every project I do. But I understand with my previous
              experience was not sufficient enough to make me become a professional software developer.
              Therefore I decided to study a course that could bring me all the skills are required in 
              this constantly changing industry. During my study, I was not afraid of tacking unknown 
              problems or starting rough new project.  I write code, problem solving and working with a 
              team to created a web and provide detailed information for the public to search the places 
              they want to go. The website works very well with testable code and we achieved with A+. 
              </p>  
              <p>  
              Knowledges in  HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and NodeJS, Java, C#, C++ and assemble 
              language  
              </p>
