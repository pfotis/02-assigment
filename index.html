                      My name is Peter i am living the last 9 years in Melbourne. In September of 2011 
                      i finished from the Greek army.  After i started to look for job but it was 
                      challenging because the European economy effect most Greece at this time. My 
                      decision it was to come to Melbourne for two reasons first to see the city i 
                      was born and second better opportunity for me. The begin i was disappointed for 
                      me but after 9 years here i love Melbourne. The only first two months i was 
                      unemployment. My first job is in the same factory I am at this time. I started 
                      in the production of mattresses . One year later I moved in better position at 
                      receiving department with more responsibilities. And now I am enrol in the boot 
                      camp in Monash, to extend my skills and to become web developer. My goals from 
                      this course is first to graduate from the boot camp and to make my wife proud 
                      for me. Second to be a web developer and third to find job as web developer.
